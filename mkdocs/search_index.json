It is much easier to work with JS object than working manually with database.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nvar pgStructure = require('pg-structure');\n\npgStructure({database: 'db', user: 'user', password: 'password'}, ['public', 'other_schema'])\n    .then((db) =\n { console.log( db.get('public.account').columns.get('is_active').type ); })\n    .catch(err =\n console.log(err.stack));\n\n\n\nDetailed Example\n\n\nvar pgStructure = require('pg-structure');\n\npgStructure({database: 'db', user: 'user', password: 'password', host: 'localhost', port: 5432}, ['public', 'other_schema'])\n    .then((db) =\n {\n        // Basic\n        var tables = db.schemas.get('public').tables;  // Map of Table objects.\n\n        // List of table names\n        for (let table of tables.values()) {\n            console.log(table.name);\n        }\n\n        // Long chain example for:\n        // public schema -\n cart table -\n contact_id column -\n foreign key constraints of contact_id.\n        var constraints = db.get('public.cart.contact_id').foreignKeyConstraints;\n        var sameName = db.schemas.get('public').tables.get('cart').columns.get('contact_id').foreignKeyConstraints;\n\n        // Many to many relation.

If you use \n.zip\n extension, pg-structure automatically\ncompresses file as zip file. \n\n\nvar pgStructure = require('pg-structure');\n\npgStructure({database: 'db', user: 'user', password: 'password', host: 'localhost', port: 5432}, ['public', 'other_schema'])\n    .then(db =\n pgStructure.save('./db.zip', db))\n    .catch(err =\n console.log(err.stack));\n\n\n\n... Later, you can load pg-structure. Loading is 10 times faster than reverse engineering database.  \n\n\nvar pgStructure = require('pg-structure');\n\npgStructure.load('./db.zip')\n    .then(db =\n console.log(db.schemas.get('public').name))\n    .catch(err =\n console.log(err.stack));\n\n\n\nCaveat\n: pgStructure cannot\nload files saved by incompatible pg-structure module versions and returns \nundefined\n. In this case you should\nfetch structure from database and create a new save file.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nFully tested\n\n\nFully documented with JSDOC and HTML\n\n\nSupports load, save, serialize, deserialize, toString, parse.\n\n\nAll PostgreSQL data types including array, JSON and HSTore\n\n\nSupport composite keys (Multiple field keys)\n\n\nSchema support\n\n\nConstraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique).\n\n\nSupports multi-column constraints.\n\n\nIdentifies one to many (hasMany) relationships.\n\n\nIdentifies reverse of one to many (belongsTo) relationships\n\n\nIdentifies all possible many to many (belongs to many \n has many through) relationships\n\n\nObjects can be accessed by name or by order.

Now complex is selected when there are conflicts between cross types of \no2m\n and \nm2m\n.\n\n\nAdded: Relation naming documentation.\n\n\nAdded: Naming strategy test.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.0\n\n\n\n\nChanged: \ntable#descriptionData\n tag is changed from \n[JSON]\n to \n[pg-structure]\n\n\n(EXPERIMENTAL) Added: \no2mRelation#generateName()\n, \nm2oRelation#generateName()\n, \nm2mRelation#generateName()\n. Those methods are highly experimental and may be changed or deleted.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 / 2016-02-25\n\n\n\n\nFixed: Tables without primary key was throwing exception for \ntable#primaryKeyColumns\n.\n\n\nFixed: \ntable#hasManyTables\n and \ntable#belongsToTables\n were returning array instead of Set.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.0 / 2016-02-24\n\n\n\n\nAdded: \ntable#descriptionData\n, \ntable#commentData\n, \ncolumn#descriptionData\n, \ncolumn#commentData\n, \nconstraint#descriptionData\n, \nconstraint#commentData\n. It is possible to store and access JSON in objects' description.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.0 / 2016-02-24\n\n\n\n\nAdded:\nconstraint#description\n, \nconstraint#comment\n.\n\n\nUpdated: Test ERD corrected.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 / 2016-01-30\n\n\n\n\nAdded: \ncolumn#referencedColumns\n.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.0 / 2016-01-26\n\n\n\n\nAdded: \n#array\n method is added all Map types to help building arrays in non supporting environments such as nunjucks.\n\n\n\n\n3.0.0 / 2016-01-16\n\n\nPrevious versions of pg-structure are designed to be a build time tool. v3 are designed to be a runtime tool. It is refactored to better performance compared to previous versions.\nInternal storage is completely rewritten. Loki DB is excellent product, but it is overkill for this project. pg-structure now uses direct object references for speed up things.\nDB interaction is reduced from 9 SQL queries to 3. Those 3 queries are same queries from previous version. So work of other 6 queries are done by Javascript now.\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Change: \nColumn#foreignKeyConstraint\n is changed to \nColumn#foreignKeyConstraints\n, \nColumn#referencedColumn\n is removed,\nbecause same column may be part of multiple different foreign key constraints which results in referencing different columns\nin different tables at the same time.\n\n\nBreaking Change: All \n...ByName\n such as \nTable#columnsByName\n methods are removed, and collections such as \nTable#columns\n return Map instead of array or object.\nMaps return values in order like arrays and they can be queried with \n.has\n method like objects.\n\n\nBreaking Change: \nColumn#uniqueIndexesNoPK\n is renamed as \nColumn#uniqueIndexesNoPk\n.\n\n\nAdded: Optional Lazy loading, cache of lazy loaded parts, invalidation logic of cache.\n\n\nAdded: \npgStructure.serialize\n and \npgStructure.deserialize\n methods.\n\n\nAdded: \npgStructure.save\n and \npgStructure.load\n methods. Load is 10 times faster than querying database. \n\n\nAdded: \nColumn#domainSchema\n\n\nAdded: \nConstraint#matchOption\n, \nConstraint#referencedColumnsBy\n\n\nAdded: \nTable#belongsToManyTablesPk\n, \nTable#m2mRelationsPk\n\n\nDoc updates and changes.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.8 / 2015-12-09\n\n\n\n\nAdded: \nTable#description\n and \nTable#comment\n attributes added to the table object.\n\n\nFixed: Table sql was returning null for table descriptions. \n\n\n\n\n2.0.5 / 2015-12-08\n\n\n\n\nChanged: Code and API cleanup and simplification since alpha releases.\n\n\nChanged: Array and collection object returning attributes now return empty array or empty object if no result found. Previously they returned null. They are usually used in loops, and this change helps getting rid of null checks.\n\n\nRemoved: All methods which are duplicate of attributes. They cause duplicated code and don't add any useful contribution. Same can be achieved using attributes with foreach and better can be achieved with for..of. \n\n\n\n\n2.0.0-alpha.9 / 2015-11-29\n\n\n\n\nFixed: One to many and many to one relations duplicates.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.0-alpha.8 / 2015-11-29\n\n\n\n\nFixed: Join tables with more than one relations produce warning about non-unique constraint.\n\n\nFixed: referencedTable returns undefined.\n\n\nFixed: Example on README throws exception. Typo corrected. Catch part added.\n\n\nAdded: New tests for fixed bugs.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.0-alpha.5 / 2015-11-19\n\n\n\n\nAdded: Table#relations and Table#getRelations().\n\n\n\n\n2.0.0-alpha.3 / 2015-11-19\n\n\n\n\nFixed: Broken links in documentation.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.0-alpha.2 / 2015-11-17\n\n\n\n\nAdded: Index class is added.\n\n\nFixed: Column#unique was assuming that a column can have only one unique constraint. Now it returns array.\n\n\nFixed: Column#unique was ignoring unique indexes Now it considers unique indexes too.\n\n\nFixed: Many typos in constraint class documentation.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.0-alpha.1 / 2015-11-11\n\n\n\n\n BREAKING CHANGES \n\n\nCompletely rewritten.\n\n\nMethods are converted to read only attributes.\n\n\nNew methods are named as verb such as getColumn().\n\n\nNew classes added: Relation, O2MRelation (one to many), M2ORelation (many to one), M2M Relation (many to many).\n\n\nConstraint features that are technically not available in DB Engine moved from \nConstraint\n class to related \nRelation\n classes.\n\n\nDocumentation updated completely and added clearer examples.\n\n\nSome method names and attributes are more intuitive than previous version.\n\n\n\n\nWhy v2 has incompatible changes?\n\n\nVersion 2 is designed to be more elegant and more intuitive. Methods are changed to read only attributes and new methods\n are easily distinguished from attributes with verb based names such as \ncolumns\n vs \ngetColumns()\n.\n\n\nAdditionally new \nRelation\n classes are added. Some of the features are moved from \nConstraint\n to \nRelation\n,\n because some features are technically not available in DB Engine and those features misrepresent \nConstraint\n.\n\n\nFor example many to many relations are virtual relationships which do not actually exist in database. They are\ntables joined via a third join table.\n\n\n1.11.1 / 2015-06-16\n\n\n\n\nAdded: JSONB support. Contributed by: viniciuspinto (https://github.com/viniciuspinto)\n\n\n\n\n1.11.0 / 2014-12-30\n\n\n\n\nAdded: Constraint.throughForeignKeyConstraintToSelf() method added.\n\n\nAdded: Winston logging.\n\n\nFixed: Many to Many relations has name collisions if join table connects more than one table and one of the tables has more than one connection to join table. Naming of many to many relations changed.\n\n\n\n\n1.10.0 / 2014-12-23\n\n\n\n\nAdded: db.includedSchemas method to get list of requested schemas to be parsed.\n\n\nAdded: db.schemaIncluded method to determine if given schema name is one of the requested schemas to be parsed.\n\n\nFix: If a table has a reference to not included schema, throws exception. Should not include its foreign key.\n\n\nDoc update.\n\n\n\n\n1.9.0 / 2014-12-12\n\n\n\n\nAdded: table.hasManyThrough.throughForeignKeyConstraint method added to constraint class.\n\n\n\n\n1.8.3 / 2014-12-10\n\n\n\n\nFix: Sequelize type length, precision.\n\n\n\n\n1.8.2 / 2014-12-10\n\n\n\n\nFix: Sequelize type date, time etc. has no length property.\n\n\nFix: Sequelize type dateonly added.\n\n\nTests added.\n\n\n\n\n1.8.0 / 2014-12-10\n\n\n\n\nAdded: Shortcut function 'get' added to db, schema and table classes.\n\n\nFix: hasManyThrough does not return foreign keys.\n\n\n\n\n1.7.0 / 2014-12-10\n\n\n\n\nAdded: onDelete and onUpdate added to hasMany and hasManyThrough relations.\n\n\n\n\n1.6.0 / 2014-12-10\n\n\n\n\nDEPRECATED: column.special function. Use column.enumValues instead.\n\n\nAdded: Tests for enum values.\n\n\nAdded: Enum support for column.sequelizeType function.\n\n\nUpdated: Documentation\n\n\n\n\n1.5.1 / 2014-12-04\n\n\n\n\nFix: Test db does not destroyed after tests.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.0 / 2014-12-04\n\n\n\n\nFix: column.default() method returns default value with type cast. From now on yype cast part is stripped.\n\n\nAdded column.defaultWithTypeCast() method for getting default values with type cast part.\n\n\nTests added for default values.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.0 / 2014-11-28\n\n\n\n\nAdded support for user-defined types.\n\n\nAdded column.udType() method to get user defined type name.\n\n\nAdded necessary tests.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1 / 2014-11-27\n\n\n\n\nAdded history to readme.\n\n\nFix: Major error: Single schema or default 'public' schema databases throw error.\n\n\nFix: Databases without any table throw error.\n\n\nAdded tests of this fixes and table without any column.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.0 / 2014-11-27\n\n\n\n\nParameter validation added to pg-structure main function. This would ease debugging.\n\n\nFix: pg-structure.generate function was throwing error, now it calls its callback with error\nif database connection error occurs.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.0 / 2014-11-26\n\n\n\n\nFix: pg-structure callback does not get error object. Instead error is thrown. Now callback gets error object as its first parameter as expected.\n\n\ndb.schema() function now throws more informative error if referenced schema is not found in db and also not in the options of requested schemas.\n\n\ndb.schemaExist() function added.\n\n\nHistory.md file added. (This file)\n\n\n\n\n1.1.0 / 2014-11-25\n\n\n\n\ntable.foreignKeyConstraintExist() function added.\n\n\n\n\n1.0.0 / 2014-11-25\n\n\n\n\nCompletely rewritten to migrate from plain object to object oriented design.\n\n\ncolumn.sequelizeType() method added. This method gets sequelize compatible type of the column.",

Those 3 queries are same queries from previous version. So work of other 6 queries are done by Javascript now.   Breaking Change:  Column#foreignKeyConstraint  is changed to  Column#foreignKeyConstraints ,  Column#referencedColumn  is removed,\nbecause same column may be part of multiple different foreign key constraints which results in referencing different columns\nin different tables at the same time.  Breaking Change: All  ...ByName  such as  Table#columnsByName  methods are removed, and collections such as  Table#columns  return Map instead of array or object.\nMaps return values in order like arrays and they can be queried with  .has  method like objects.  Breaking Change:  Column#uniqueIndexesNoPK  is renamed as  Column#uniqueIndexesNoPk .  Added: Optional Lazy loading, cache of lazy loaded parts, invalidation logic of cache.  Added:  pgStructure.serialize  and  pgStructure.deserialize  methods.  Added:  pgStructure.save  and  pgStructure.load  methods. Load is 10 times faster than querying database.

            "text": "Relation Names\n\n\nActually database systems does not have relations. They have foreign key constraints. Relation is a concept to describe relationships between tables based on foreign key constraints. \npg-structure\n provides \nO2MRelation\n, \nM2MRelation\n and \nM2ORelation\n classes relations.\n\n\nSince relations are not real objects defined in database systems, they do not have names. Relation names used in ORM systems should generated somehow. Naming is already very complex mental process and there are multiple methods and preferences to name relations. \npg-structure\n provides more than one strategy to generate names for different preferences and to reduce chance of conflicting names. They aren't perfect, but at least does the job for most of the time.\n\n\nStrategies\n\n\nTo name relations \npg-structure\n provides strategies below. All strategies tries to guess inflection of table names such as snake_case or CamelCase with a simple test. If first letter is capital, then it is assumed CamelCase, snake_case otherwise. Generated names use guessed inflection.\n\n\nWhen \ngenerateName()\n method is called without any strategies, \npg-structure\n chooses simple strategy. If there are more than one relation between same tables, additional relations are named using complex strategy to prevent conflicts.\n\n\nBelow is a database schema as an example:\n\n\n size -------------------\n id (PK)                |  ---------------------------\n line_item \n------------ cart\n name                   |  |                            product_id (PFK)        id (PK)\n                        |  |                            cart_id    (PFK)        name\n                        ^  |\n color -------------\n product \n------------- vendor\n id (PK)              id        (PK)         id (PK)\n name                 name                   name\n                      color_id  (FK)\n                      size_id   (FK)\n                      vendor_id (FK)\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the same schema as image:\n \n\n\nO2M examples are given for:\n\n\nproduct ---\n line_item\n (i.e. \nproduct.o2mRelations.values()[0].generateName('simple')\n).\n\n\nM2O examples are given for:\n\n\nline_item \n--- product\n (i.e. \nlineItem.m2oRelations.values()[0].generateName('simple')\n).\n\n\nM2M examples are given for:\n\n\nproduct ---\n line_item \n--- cart\n (i.e. \nproduct.m2mRelations.values()[0].generateName('simple')\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelation\n\n\nForm\n\n\nStrategy\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO2M\n\n\nsimple\n\n\nPlural\n\n\nTarget table name.\n\n\nline_items\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO2M\n\n\ncomplex\n\n\nPlural\n\n\nConstraint name, but source table name stripped from beginning.\n\n\nsold_items\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM2O\n\n\nsimple\n\n\nSingular\n\n\nTarget table name.\n\n\nproduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM2O\n\n\ncomplex\n\n\nSingular\n\n\nFirst foreign key column name.

If 'id' string is present, it is stripped, otherwise 'related' prefix added.\n\n\nline_item_carts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverriding\n\n\nEven using complex strategy, it is sometimes impossible to generate unique names. In that case it is possible to override generated names by providing clues to \npg-structure\n in database.\n\n\nUsing Constraint Description Data (!EXPERIMENTAL)\n\n\nYou can use constraint's description in PostgreSQL. Description data is fetched from constraint description.

Relation is a concept to describe relationships between tables based on foreign key constraints.  pg-structure  provides  O2MRelation ,  M2MRelation  and  M2ORelation  classes relations.  Since relations are not real objects defined in database systems, they do not have names. Relation names used in ORM systems should generated somehow. Naming is already very complex mental process and there are multiple methods and preferences to name relations.  pg-structure  provides more than one strategy to generate names for different preferences and to reduce chance of conflicting names.
